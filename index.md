### Introduction and Professional Self-Assessment


### The Campsite Locator App

For my Computer Science Capstone project, I’ve decided to improve upon one multifaceted artifact from a previous course to demonstrate my knowledge and skill in 3 different key areas of computer science which are: software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, and databases. This artifact is an Android Mobile application that was created throughout my Mobile Architecture and Programming course (CS-360) at Southern New Hampshire University. This app was named Campsite Locator App and, the purpose of the app is to provide users an easy-to-use interface to locate campsites based on their desired search criteria queried from a database of campsites.

### My Narratives
#### Software Engineering and Design:
I selected this item because there were many potential improvements to the software engineering and design that could have been made to the project. The specific component of the Campsite Locator App that showcases my skills and abilities in software development is the search results page. The initial application I created (during my CS-360 course) enabled users to search for a campsite by name, feature, or location. However, the results displayed by the app were constrained to exactly three (3) results, even if there were more or less campsites that matched the query, because I had used a Linear Layout. I enhanced the software design by making use of Recycler View provided by Android Studio in the layout xml file so that the search results being displayed were not limited to 3 campsites. I showcased my skills and abilities in software development by changing the software design from a Linear Layout to a more advanced and complicated Recycler View in order to meet the goal of expanding or contracting the display to match the actual number of search results. This reduced the reptitive code and elmininated the need to know the number of results when developing the design, before conducting the search. I also added comments to help adequately document and clearly explain what each section of code accomplishes.

There were many challenges and lessons learned as I improved the search results page of the Campsite Locator app. I learned that there were many components to implementing Recycler View in Android Studio which required me to create additional layout files and classes. I learned that the three main components to implementing Recycler View are the layout manager, the adapter, and the view holder. The most challenge concept to understand was learning how the adapter, view holder, layout file, and search results activity class depended on and connected to each other. I read the Android documentation and watched video tutorials to help conceptualize all the components. Ultimately, I was able to successfully implement the Recycler View and my app now expands or contract the results page accordingly to present the accurate number of results from a query.


#### Data Structures and Algorithms:
I selected to enhance the search results page and the database handler because they are the specific components within the app that showcase my skills and abilities in applying data structures and algorithms to a software application. 
In conjunction with improving the software design component by utilizing Recycler View in Milestone 2, for this enhancement, the data structures and algorithms were developed further to accomplish the goal of displaying all campsite results retrieved from the database. The main data structure used in the Search Results Activity java file of the app was the ArrayList, which is used to store the results from the database query. Initially, the algorithm used a linear sequence of conditional if-statements and numerous variables to extract only the first 3 results from the array list. The algorithm was made more efficient by using if- and else-if statements to call the database handler method and store all the results. By implementing the Recycler View, and adding an adapter, the number of variables required in the Search Results class was reduced while quickly displaying the correct number of results. A sorting algorithm was also added to the search results class so that they are sorted in alphabetical in order. 
Additionally, the algorithm used in the database handler was enhanced by updating the search method to take two parameters instead of one. This optimized the database handler class and made the search method better-organized because condensed blocks of repeated and redundant code into a single procedure. I also added exception handling with try-catch statements to help make the code more secure and handle errors without crashing the app. Finally, supplementary comments were added to both the Search Results and Database Handlers classes to further communicate and clarify sections of  code and improve readability.

There were many challenges and lessons learned as I improved the data structures and algorithms of the Campsite Locator app. The most important lesson I learned was that simpler is better. If there are blocks of repeated code, there are most likely ways to make the algorithm more proficient using loops, conditional statements, and/or adding input parameters. I also learned how to use the built-in Java Collections class to sort the objects in my array list. Again, I learned to not try to reinvent my own sorting methods and chose a more resourceful path. Finally, I reaffirmed the importance of precise and effective commenting to communicate the functionality and reasoning in my coding decisions. The biggest challenge I faced during this enhancement was learning to keep a security mindset and add exception handling to my algorithms to handle errors gracefully. Figuring out where I needed to add try-catch statements was the hardest part.


#### Databases:
I selected to enhance the database in the campsite locator app so that I could implement more secure code, learn more advanced concepts of SQLite with Android Studio, and improve by database skills. The original database was stored locally on the user’s device and did not contain any initial campsite data. Having a database without data does not meet industry standards in software application development. Therefore, I created more robust and efficient code to deliver value and accomplish the  goal of having a usable database. I learned how to add initial data to database so that the app is usable from the start without requiring the user to add their own data to the database. I also added a layer of security to the login information and made the database more secure. This required the passwords to be encrypted and hashed before they were stored on the user’s mobile device. Encryption and hashing both help to maintain the privacy and security of the user’s data. First, I implemented Encrypted Shared Preferences instead of the original shared preferences to store the password in their Shared Preferences file. This allowed the user to save their login info without having to retype in their username and password every time they used the app while reducing security concerns because their information is encrypted while stored on the device. Also, I implemented a widely used cryptographic hash function, MD5, using Java’s API MessageDigest Class to hash the password before storing it in the SQLite database. By using hashing, I improved the security of the app because even if the device was hacked and the database became visible to hackers, the user’s password would be disguised and unable to be decrypted.

The process of enhancing security and modifying the application to include a usable database was the most challenging part of this entire project. As I was improving the security, I learned that there are many different approaches in Java API and other 3rd party API’s to help secure and store information safely. I learned the difference between hashing and encryption and learned that it’s important to know which functions to use, when to use them, and how to properly implement them. Additionally, I learned more about the limitations and intentions behind SQLite. I originally planned to connect my database to the internet so that the information was stored in one central location instead of locally. However, after some research I realized that was not the intention behind SQLite. I found out that SQLite is usually used as a local database and it is not intended to be used as a client/server database so does not support multiple users. In other words, because it’s not a server, I would have to wrap a web service in front of it. Moving forward if I need to have a central database with multiuser access for my Mobile application,  I will probably use online database services such as Google’s Firebase instead of using SQLite.
