### Introduction and Professional Self-Assessment

The Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), has helped reinforce my strengths, shaped my professional goals, and prepared me to enter the computer science field. Throughout my CS degree, I’ve learned countless technical and non-technical skills by successfully completing challenging projects in my coursework and developing an ePortfolio, to showcase some of my abilities. Such skills include software development life cycle (SDLC), Java programming, object-oriented programming in C++, Python, data structures and algorithms, databases, collaborating in a team environment, communicating to stakeholders, and security. To collaborate in a team environment, I learned to use Git, GitHub, BitBucket and have shared and uploaded my work to remote repositories. I’ve also learned to work with both relational databases such as MySQL, SQLite, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB. During my software development lifecycle course, a software testing and QA course, and this CS capstone course I’ve learned to effectively communicate with stakeholders and develop a security mindset. The computer science degree program at SNHU has taught me a great deal of valuable skills to become gainfully employed as a software developer. By exercising algorithmic principles, computer science practices and appropriate standards, I’ve learned to develop and engineer software solutions that deliver value. Most importantly, I’ve gained the ability to evaluate and design solutions that solve a given computing problem using a wide range of innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices.  

For my Computer Science Capstone project, I chose to improve upon the Campsite Locator app because there were many components to the application that help demonstrate the full range of my computer science talents and abilities, including data structures and algorithms, software engineering and design, and databases. There were five specific goals to achieve in this capstone project and I will discuss how each of these were met.

The first goal was to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. I exhibited my skills in building a collaborative environment by providing contextual, in-code comments that result in easily readable and understandable code. This strategy aids in communicating with diverse audiences in the field of computer science, which aligns with this course outcome. I have also created narratives and written this reflection of my capstone project and my experience in the Computer Science program as a whole to prove my ability to communicate appropriately to specific audiences and contexts. This self-assessment communicates my successful achievement of all course outcomes by discussing experiences and best practices learned while working in both collaborative and solo environments

The next goal in this CS capstone was to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. I’ve accomplished this goal by showcasing my ability to understand and conduct code reviews and used oral communication to create a code-review experience of the Campsite Locator app through a video/screencast. I delivered professional-quality oral discussions about the existing functionality of the app by walking through and identifying what the code is, what it does, and how it works. I adapted to my specific technical audience by reviewing the structure, looking for code efficiencies, and checking for comments and code documentation. The written narratives for each of the artifacts also demonstrate my ability to clearly convey my ideas and explain my thought process through written communication. The written narratives describe what my artifact is, when it was it created, and why I chose to include the artifact in my Portfolio. This written communication aids in verifying which specific components of the artifact showcase my skills and abilities in software development.

The third goal was to design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. I met this course outcome by demonstrating my skills and ability to program solutions to logic problems using data structures and algorithms in the search function of the app. I analyzed my previous design choices in the Campsite locator app and I was able to optimize the algorithms, and reduce redundancy, to create a more robust and efficient design. The search function was updated in conjunction with implementing Recycler View instead of a Linear Layout to display search results.

The fourth goal in my CS capstone project was to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I met this course outcome and by using more advanced techniques and tools provided by Android Studio to upgrade the functionality of the app and deliver a more scalable industry-standard software design. Initially, the Campsite search results were limited to display exactly 3 results which did not meet industry standards in software application development. I made use of Recycler View and implemented it in my code to deliver value and accomplish the goal of displaying the accurate number of results. Additionally, the database was updated to be populated with data upon the start of the app so that users did not need to add their own data which adds value and accomplishes industry-specific goals of having a usable database.

The final goal was to develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. I met this course outcome by analyzing my software architecture and design, coming up with ways to mitigate design flaws, and proving my ability to find and reduce security vulnerabilities and bugs. I enhanced the security of the password data to help ensure privacy of the Campsite Locator app’s users. Encryption was added to the shared preferences and hashing was added prior to storing the password in the database. I also updated my code and learned to keep a security mindset by adding exception handling to my algorithms when necessary to handle errors gracefully.




### The Campsite Locator App

For my Computer Science Capstone project, I’ve decided to improve upon one multifaceted artifact from a previous course to demonstrate my knowledge and skill in 3 different key areas of computer science which are: software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, and databases. This artifact is an Android Mobile application that was created throughout my Mobile Architecture and Programming course (CS-360) at Southern New Hampshire University. This app was named Campsite Locator App and, the purpose of the app is to provide users an easy-to-use interface to locate campsites based on their desired search criteria queried from a database of campsites.
