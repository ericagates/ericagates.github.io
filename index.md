### Professional Self-Assessment


### The Campsite Locator App

For my Computer Science Capstone project, Iâ€™ve decided to improve upon one multifaceted artifact from a previous course to demonstrate my knowledge and skill in 3 different key areas of computer science which are: software engineering and design, data structures and algorithms, and databases. This artifact is an Android Mobile application that was created throughout my Mobile Architecture and Programming course (CS-360) at Southern New Hampshire University. This app was named Campsite Locator App and, the purpose of the app is to provide users an easy-to-use interface to locate campsites based on their desired search criteria queried from a database of campsites.
